Now we want to stick all of our data into a DataLoader object so that we can begin the process of training our model.\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(path, files, label_func, item_tfms=Resize(224))\n\nOK, now let’s just take a moment to see that the images are all loaded into the DataLoader object properly:\n\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\nLooking good! We are now ready to try training a model. We are going to use an old favourite that works quite well while also being quite small - the ResNet34 model.\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)"
